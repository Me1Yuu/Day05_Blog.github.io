        <p>Welcome to my blog! Here, I share my thoughts and experiences on various topics.</p>

            <h2>My current situation</h2>
            <p>In today's blog, I would like to talk about my current situation. <br>I am currently undergoing a
                retraining
                program
                in Lutz and Grub for IT-Specialist in Application Development. <br>I am also temporarily employed as
                an intern there, as I did not find a traditional internship in time. <br>Our daily task is to search for
                places
                where we can complete our final project.</p>

            <h2>My future plans</h2>
            <p>In the future, I plan to continue my education and gain more experience in the field of IT. <br>I want to
                specialize in web development and learn more about programming languages such as JavaScript and Python.
                <br>I
                also plan to work on personal projects to improve my skills and build a portfolio. <br>
                Plus, my dream is to work in home-office.</p>
